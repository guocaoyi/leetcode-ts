## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**
```shell
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

**Example 1:**
```txt
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
**Example 2:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
