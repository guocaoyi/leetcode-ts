/**
 * # 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 *
 * Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 * ```
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * ```
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 *              Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 * ```
