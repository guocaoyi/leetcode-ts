/**
 * # 1094. Car Pooling
 *
 * You are driving a vehicle that has `capacity` empty seats initially available for passengers.
 * The vehicle **only** drives east (ie. it **cannot** turn around and drive west.)
 *
 * Given a list of `trips, trip[i] = [num_passengers, start_location, end_location]` contains information about
 * the `i-th` trip:
 * the number of passengers that must be picked up, and the locations to pick them up and drop them off.
 * The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.
 *
 * Return `true` if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
 * Output: false
 * ```
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
 * Output: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,5,7]], capacity = 3
 * Output: true
 * ```
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input: trips = [[3,2,7],[3,7,9],[8,3,9]], capacity = 11
 * Output: true
 * ```
 *
 * ## Constrains
 *
 * 1. `trips.length <= 1000`
 * 2. `trips[i].length == 3`
 * 3. `1 <= trips[i][0] <= 100`
 * 4. `0 <= trips[i][1] < trips[i][2] <= 100`
 * 5. `1 <= capacity <= 100000`
