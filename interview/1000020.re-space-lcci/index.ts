/**
 * 面试题 17.13. Re-Space LCCI
 *
 * Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" became "iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot''. You'll deal with the punctuation and capi­talization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string), design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters. Return the number of unrecognized characters.
 *
 * # Note
 *
 * This problem is slightly different from the original one in the book.
 *
 * ```bash
 * Input:
 * dictionary = ["looked","just","like","her","brother"]
 * sentence = "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother"
 * Output:  7
 * Explanation:  After unconcatenating, we got "jess looked just like tim her brother", which containing 7 unrecognized characters.
 * ```
 *
 * ## Note
 *
 * - `0 <= len(sentence) <= 1000`
 * - The total number of characters in dictionary is less than or equal to 150000.
 * - There are only lowercase letters in dictionary and sentence.
