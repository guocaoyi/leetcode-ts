# 4. Median of Tow Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

## Example

```bash
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

```bash
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
