# 136. Single Number

Given a `non-empty` array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

## Note

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example

```bash
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

```bash
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
